# KiCAD Parts Blueprint Generator

The KiCAD Parts Blueprint Generator is a tool designed to assist hardware developers in creating unique and potentially patentable blueprints for electronic components. By providing specifications and requirements, the tool generates KiCAD parts (.lib) files that can be used to design hardware components with KiCAD EDA software.

## Features

- Interactive prompts for specifying hardware component requirements.
- Generation of KiCAD parts (.lib) files based on user input.
- Preliminary patent check to avoid infringement on existing patents.
